	<entry key="story.text.1">It was one of these beautiful summer days. Emma got
	herself ready to drive to the office. While opening the outside door
	she suddenly turned around, stopped for a moment, and then hurriedly ran
	back to her bedroom. She vehemently pulled the wardrobe door open
	because all of a sudden she remembered that she’d have a date after
	work and before her company’s summer party.&lt;br/&gt;
	It was supposed to be one of these countless blind dates, which she was
	sick of and bored already. However she wanted to be well prepared and
	she decided to choose her outfit suitable for the special event.  So
	she chose a short summer dress that accentuates her body very well.
	The shoes fitting to her dress were found quickly and so she was ready to
	face the day in front of her.</entry>
